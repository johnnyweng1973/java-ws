1)JUNIT
a)JUNIT is a unit test framework provided by java. org.junit.jupiter.*. it is used to test methods (simplied use) or other (springboot) 
b)its source code is in src/test/a.b.c. it is in the same package with the java code. 
c)@Test is used to annotate the test method. Junit framework will call methods with @Test automatically
       Class<?> clazz = YouTestClass.class; // every class has a Class object named class. 
       Object object = clazz.newInstance();
       Method[] methods = clazz.getTestMethods();  //get methods with @Test annotation, this is a conceptual method
       for (Method method: methods) {
           method.invoke(object); // invoke is run by java runtime ,  methods from clazz and method are called reflection API.
       }
d) inside method with @Test: it represent a unit test. use Assertion methods provided by Junit to check return value of the method() you are gonna test.
