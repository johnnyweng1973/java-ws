1.At the test launch page /test, users can initiate a test with options of subject, category, and subcategory by clicking a button, which sends the request to the Test Service's endpoint /test_subject on port 8084.

2 The Test Service queries the 'test_problem' table in the MySQL database to retrieve a list of previously tested problems. It then sends the IDs and subcategories of these problems in the JSON body of an HTTP request to the Problem Service's endpoint /math/test-rest on port 8080, with the purpose of requesting problems that have not been tested before.

3. The Problem Service queries the 'problem_table' in the MySQL database to retrieve a problem list and send the list in the JSON body of an HTTP response back to the Test Service.

4. The Test Service extracts the problem list by parsing the JSON body, adds it into an HTML template using Thymeleaf, and then sends the resulting page back to client.

"19","Chinese Character Encoding in Java","","1. Relationship Between UTF-16 UTF-8 and Unicode
Each character, whether ASCII or a Chinese character, corresponds to a Unicode code point. UTF-16 and UTF-8 are encoding schemes used to encode Unicode.

2. How java store a Chinese character
1)Java use strings to store Chinese characters. 
2)From my experience, A character has two coding schemes:  physically it is stored as UTF-16 encodings, but as a char array, its value is a Unicode code point. 

In java, a character is encoded with utf-16 and its length is two byte.
For example 丰 0x4E30 E4 B8 B0 ,  its Unicode code point is 0x4e30   and  its raw data is E4b8b0. A Chinese character is represented  as a string to support lengths of greater than two. 

3. How JSOUP Decodes Chinese Character
1.) Specify charsetname in its parse method. In my case, it is ""GBK"".
2)  Check HTML meta tag for its encoding type. In my case it is a Chinese encoding

When submitted to the service endpoint ""/test"", all test problems created in the database have empty fields except IDs.
                   
Issue Diagnosis: 
1. Check Transmission.
    Analyzed HTTP messages captured by Wireshark, but relevant HTTP messages are too large to decode.
2.  Inspect the Problem Objects 
   It was observed that these object properties were all empty values, indicating an issue with data population.

Root Cause: Data Population Issue:
   The root cause of the problem lies in accessing problem fields by their indices within a table row. This method leads to errors when the row structure changes, as seen when a new field was added.

Solution:
  To address the issue, problem fields should be accessed by their names instead of their indices. This approach ensures that changes in the row structure do not affect data retrieval.

2. Check Server Side Code
   The server expects this parameter in the URL and will automatically convert it into a boolean type, passing it as an input parameter to corresponding handler. 

Root Cause:
Mismatch between the parameter name expected by the server-side (Spring) and that used in the client-side (JavaScript). Server-side expects parameter name ""noSpellingCheckBox"" but client-side uses ""noSpelling"".
