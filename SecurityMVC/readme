this project originated from spring boot web security example.
The framework of the project is :
1. A configure file which adds viewcontroller with endopoint and html pages. we dont need to use
@Controller. In Restapi, we dont need to assign endpoint with a html page.
2. A security configure file. It create a SecurityFilterChain and A in memoery usersevice manager.

The logic is :
1. we need to apply the following security rule:
   1. everyone can access /home
   2. other requests should be authenticated
   3. we need a customized login form. everyone can access that form.
   4. need a logout form. I guess if we dont specify it, it will reuse login form.

http flow of login is:
1. user request a endpoint that require authentication
2. server return with 430 to redirect to login page
3. user request login page 
4. server return login page
5. user send username and password in html body with post method
6. if authentication success, server return with 302 which indicate a new page like /hello?continue
