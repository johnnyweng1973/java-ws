This project provides authentication feature, the same as SecurityApp. But it can configure
authentication filter, adding filters to the filter chain.
The policies it configures are:
    allow everybody access home page, access css page, access login page
    other requests need to be authenticated.
    customize login page. 
user submit login data by http post to login page with username and password. spring framework
will handle authentication of username and password automatically

Thymeleaf is used to render the web page. it is better than java server page in that it does not use java code
css is used.
