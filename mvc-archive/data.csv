html and css,1,html and css,html,1. html loading
    Parsing HTML: When a browser loads an HTML document, it starts parsing the HTML from top to bottom. As it parses the HTML, it constructs the DOM tree representing the structure of the document.
2. use thymeleaf in html tag
   <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="https://www.thymeleaf.org">
    namespace is html and thymeleaf
3. use bootstrap at update_memo HTML to beautify form
   a) in html header add:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha38..
   b) in HTML body add:
     <div class="container my-5">
      bootstrap container will manage the layout of your HTML elements.
4. use <div> to divide web page into two parts vertically.
    div with class "left-container" and div with class "right-container".  in style tag at header, you define left-container takes up 20% width and right-container use flex to take the remaining space.
    then, inside each container, you define bootstrap container to manager your layout, one is a button list, the other is form.
5. padding and margin
    they are used to add space between content and border, add space after border.

 
html and css,2,hi,html,ddddfffffggggghhhhhh
several javacript,3,javascript for memo project,javacript,this javascript is an external file 
1) when javascript run
   web browser loads html file first, while parsing the content, it constructs a tree to manage the elements. if there is a javascript file as external file, it will request this file. until javascripts are loaded, DOMContentLoaded event gets triggered.

2)what javascript can do
   it can create/change/delete the elements of the tree representing that html file and also performs Ajax function

3)what does it do in your project?
       
web browser will request it after receiving HTML file. there is an ref in this HTML to this javascript.
if you update this javascript, you need to hard refresh web browser to retrieve this. otherwise web client will use cached
javascript file.
document represents this HTML file. it will add an anonymous function to execute when event DOMContentLoaded fires.
This event will fire after javascript file get retrieved but it doesn't wait for other things such as image files.  
Normally in HTML form, submitting a  button will start a post request with parameters inside HTML body. but in this
function, submitting button will start a HTTP GET request with record id. 

normally you can define button submit action through a HTML form. it is not convenient as javascript which can create
dynamic URL. 


document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var memoList = document.getElementById('memoList');

    memoList.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        var target = event.target;
        if (target && target.classList.contains('editButton')) {
            var memoId = target.getAttribute('data-memo-id');
            // Redirect to the edit page with memoId
            window.location.href = '/memo/update/' + memoId;
        }
    });
});

this file registers a function for a timer

// Define the autoSubmitForm function to submit the form
function autoSubmitForm() {
    document.getElementById('myForm').submit();
}

// Set up a timer to call autoSubmitForm every 2 minutes (120,000 milliseconds)
setInterval(autoSubmitForm, 120000); // 2 minutes = 2 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds
