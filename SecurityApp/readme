i create a new dir for workspace and add this new project for sprint boot security. Considering there may be many small projects so I dont want to create a github repo for each of them.
  so I create a repo for this workspace and all projects will under same repo.
  this project is created with spring starter option.
  project will build automatically once you create it. 

1. create project with eclipse spring starter with option web. eclipse starter is a plugin in eclipse market that support spring boot projects.
the new project will start building automatically once created
2. create a controller class in the same package as app and create a requestmapping for "/". add dependency jasper to support jsp page. its version should be same with tomcat
version, you can find tomcat version in maven dependency.
3. add dependency spring-boot-starter-security, you dont need to specify version because springboot has its own version control. a login form will appear at index page. username by default is user. and password is printed at log output.

create many changes to support In memory username/password authentication and mysql authentication. 
to put these changes to github, the following need to be done.
1. before commit changes, first update your local copy with the one in github by running "git pull"
2. git status to check unstaged files and changes
3. create .gitignore to remove .metadata from git "echo .meta/ >> .gitignore" and "git add .gitignore". This file is used by eclipse and you dont want 
to put it into git because if multiple users are using this project and people may have different eclipse configurations.
4. remove .metadata from git by running "git rm --cached -r .metadata". please use --cached otherwise .metadata will be removed from both git repo and filesystem
5. git commit and git push this change
6. git add . to add all changes to stage area and commit and push them
