i create a new dir for workspace and add this new project for sprint boot security. Considering there may be many small projects so I dont want to create a github repo for each of them.
  so I create a repo for this workspace and all projects will under same repo.
  this project is created with spring starter option.
  project will build automatically once you create it.
