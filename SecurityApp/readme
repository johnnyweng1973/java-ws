i create a new dir for workspace and add this new project for sprint boot security. Considering there may be many small projects so I dont want to create a github repo for each of them.
  so I create a repo for this workspace and all projects will under same repo.
  this project is created with spring starter option.
  project will build automatically once you create it. 

1. create project with eclipse spring starter with option web. eclipse starter is a plugin in eclipse market that support spring boot projects.
the new project will start building automatically once created
2. create a controller class in the same package as app and create a requestmapping for "/". add dependency jasper to support jsp page. its version should be same with tomcat
version, you can find tomcat version in maven dependency.
3. add dependency spring-boot-starter-security. a login form will appear at index page. username by default is user. and password is printed at log output.
4.
