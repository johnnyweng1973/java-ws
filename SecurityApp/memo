This project is a web security project, it requires authentication for HTTP requests. It has the following parts:
controller, service, repository, model, configuration.
The difference from normal projects:
   1. The service is embedded in authentication provider. This service implements interface UserDetailedService. we need to 
implement method loadUserInfo() to return UserDetail to framework.
   2. Unlike return user data to framework in the case of Restful API, framework need an instance
that implements interface UserDetail. framework will invoke methods of this interface to perform actions such as comparing username and password, etc.
so when we get user data from DAO, we need to create an instance of UserDetail which includes user data.
   3. repository is a JPA interface. JPA is a Java persistent API specification. 
   4. User class implements Jarkata persistent API, it has @Entitiy and @Id tag defined. 

How configuration class receive an injected UserDetail instance?
   UserDetail is a private member of the configuration class and it is annotated with Autowire.
so spring framework will scan the classes with has @service/controller/bean/etc to find class
that implements UserDetail.

How service class recieve an injected repo instance?
    same as above, it declares a private member of repo instance and annotated with autowire. spring framework
will create a constructor and pass in the instance in this constructor. 

How framework know which endpoints it supports?
    It searches the class with @Controller and searches RequestMapping inside. All endpoints it supports 
are defined in RequestMapping.
