This project is a web security project, it requires authentication for HTTP requests. It has the following parts:
controller, service, repository, model, configuration.
The difference from normal projects:
   1. The service is embedded in authentication provider. This service implements interface UserDetailedService. we need to 
implement method loadUserInfo() to return UserDetail to framework.
   2. Unlike return user data to framework in the case of Restful API, framework need an instance
that implements interface UserDetail. framework will invoke methods of this interface to perform actions such as comparing username and password, etc.
so when we get user data from DAO, we need to create an instance of UserDetail which includes user data.
   3. repository implements JPA interface.
